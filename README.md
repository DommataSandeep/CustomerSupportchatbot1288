# CustomerSupportchatbot1288
I developed an E-commerce Customer Support Chatbot that helps users interact with an online clothing store through a smart chat interface. The project includes a FastAPI-based backend that handles customer queries such as retrieving top-selling products, checking order status, and displaying product stock availability by reading data from CSV files using Pandas. A simple HTML and JavaScript frontend provides a user-friendly chatbot interface that communicates with the backend via REST APIs. This project demonstrates full-stack development skills, including API design, data processing, and front-end integration for a real-world e-commerce support scenario.
